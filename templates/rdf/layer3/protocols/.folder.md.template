# Folder: protocols/

> **Update Trigger:** Add new protocol when complex workflow needs documentation.
> Update existing protocols when process changes.

## Purpose

<!-- HUMAN-AUTHORED - DO NOT AUTO-GENERATE -->
Contains step-by-step protocols for AI agents handling complex workflows.
Protocols document decision trees, edge cases, and recovery procedures.

## Invariants

<!-- HUMAN-AUTHORED - DO NOT AUTO-GENERATE -->
- Each protocol must include: trigger conditions, steps, success criteria
- Protocols should be actionable, not aspirational
- Include examples of edge cases and how to handle them
