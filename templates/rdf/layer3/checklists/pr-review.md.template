## Review Best Practices

### Do
- Be specific with feedback (include file:line)
- Explain *why* something is an issue
- Offer solutions, not just problems
- Acknowledge good work
- Review promptly (< 24 hours)

### Don't
- Nitpick style if linter doesn't catch it
- Request changes for personal preference
- Leave vague comments ("this seems wrong")
- Block on minor issues
- Review when you don't have time to do it well
